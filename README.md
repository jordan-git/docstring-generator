# Docstring Generator

This extension allows you to run a simple command called "Generate Docstring" to insert a docstring where your cursor is in the currently selected language (if supported).

Missing support for a language you use? It is quite simple to add additional languages so feel free to make a pull request and I'll check it out.

**Disclaimer**: I tried to find out the standard for each language but they may not be accurate. Feel free to let me know if that is the case.

## Release Notes
